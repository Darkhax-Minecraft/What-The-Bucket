# What The Bucket

This mod fixes an old bug in Minecraft that would cause certain types of bucket items to be destroyed when using them as ingredients. For example the Bucket of Water will normally convert into an empty Bucket when used as an ingredient, however newer buckets such as the Bucket of Powder Snow do not and the bucket is lost. With this mod installed all affected vanilla buckets are fixed and will convert into empty Bucket items as expected.
